	* tag V02-02-00
	* requires FWCore/PrescaleService V00-04-00
	* reimplementation of HLTPrescaler: 'prescaleFactor' not a
	configurable parameter anymore, retrieved by querying
	PrescaleService at the beginning of each lumi block
	* missing: the PrescaleService manages a *table* of prescales,
	where the level1 trigger can initiate to switch between columns at
	lumi block boundaries; the HLTPrescaler needs to be equipped to
	retrieve the current column index from the level1 global trigger
	FED. The current implementation only support the 'MC' mode: the
	PrescaleService can be configured with a table, and each of the
	defined columns can be declared 'default' and thereby valid for
	the entire job, but no dynamic adjustments are possible.
