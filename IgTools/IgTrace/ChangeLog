	* IgTraceThrow.cc: silence a warning
	  due to what will be conditional behavior in some
	  future standard of C++, therefore currently a gcc
	  extension.

2009-09-26  Lassi A. Tuura  <lat@iki.fi>

	* IgTraceAtomic.h: Support x86-64.

2008-06-06  Lassi A. Tuura  <lat@iki.fi>

	* igtrace: Also check for mmap to see if anything was enabled.
	* IgTraceAtomic.h: Don't increment variable twice on locking.
	* IgTraceMMap.cc: Update coding convention.  Protect against
	recursive calls via memory allocations in __cxa_demangle.  Do not
	gobble symbol name if the demangling fails.

        * Updates to build with CMSSW (following the old patch for this, but
          updating "Ig_Tools" to "IgTools")
        * Add .admin/developers files

2007-11-14  Peter Elmer <Peter.Elmer@cern.ch>

        * Modify includes and BuildFiles to refer to "IgTools" rather 
          than "Ig_Tools"

2007-11-13  Peter Elmer <Peter.Elmer@cern.ch>

        * Migrate Ig_Tools/{IgHook,IgTrace,IgProf} into the CMSSW CVS 
          repository from the IGNOMINY repo, changing the subsystem name
          to "IgTools" to conform to the CMSSW conventions. The initial
          import is tagged "pe20071114-CMSSW-import" and the revision
          history prior to that should be maintained.

2007-10-22  Lassi A. Tuura  <lat@iki.fi>

	* igtrace, IgTraceMMap.cc, IgTraceThrow.cc: Support demangling.

2007-10-11  Lassi A. Tuura  <lat@iki.fi>

	* igtrace-mmap-analysis: Clarify output a bit.
	* igtrace-mmap-summary: Generate nice summary of *-analysis output.

	* igtrace-mmap-analysis: Forgot to make perl -n implicit.

	* igtrace-mmap-analysis: New, analyse memory mappings.

	* IgTraceMMap.cc: Tweak stack trace output a bit.

	* IgTraceMMap.cc: New, trace memory mappings.
	* igtrace: Support memory mapping tracing.

	* IgTraceMacros.h: Support up to 6 arguments.  Fix positioning.

2007-06-19  Lassi A. Tuura  <lat@iki.fi>

	Add support for tracing memory allocation calls.
	Generalise filter support for all trace modules.
	
	* igtrace: Support selection of trace modules.  Filters are now
	general so need to go to igtrace section.  Document all options.
	
	* IgTrace.h, IgTrace.cc, IgTraceThrow.cc: Move filter support to
	IgTrace and make it general enough for use in filter modules.

	* IgTraceMem.cc: New, trace calls to malloc().

	* IgTraceThrow.h: Removed, collapsed into source file.

2007-06-18  Lassi A. Tuura  <lat@iki.fi>

	* Initial tool to trap and report C++ exceptions thrown by an
	application.  Modeled roughly after IgProf.
