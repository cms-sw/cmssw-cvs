/** A resizeable profiler trace buffer.

    Each trace buffer tracks stack traces and their linked profiling
    counter values.  The buffer also counts resources linked with the
    counters: tracking which call stack acquired which yet-unreleased
    resource and the size of the resource.

    The buffer owner is responsible for arranging correct handling of
    the buffer in presence of multiple threads.  Buffers that do not
    track resources can be made thread-local and access need not be
    guarded.  Resource-accounting buffers must be shared among all the
    threads able to acquire or release the resource -- the resource
    records are entered into the buffer in the order of the profile
    events, but there is no other concept of time and therefore it
    would not be possible to merge buffers from multiple threads into
    a canonical time order later on.  In the rare situation the
    resources are thread-local the buffer can be thread-local too,
    otherwise the caller must ensure atomic access to the buffer.

    Technically a trace buffer consists of a header and a collection
    of fixed-size memory pools for the data, and possibly some pools
    for hash tables.  The stack trace and resource counter information
    is stored starting in one of the arrays.  If the buffer tracks
    resource information, a resource hash points to resource records.
    The trace buffer grows by allocating more memory pool as needed.

    The stack trace is represented as a tree of nodes keyed by call
    address.  Each stack frame has a singly linked list of children,
    the addresses called from that stack frame.  A frame also has a
    singly linked list of profiling counters associated with the call
    tree.  Each counter may point to a list of resources known to be
    live within that buffer; the resources linked with the counter
    form a singly linked list.  The root of the stack trace is a null
    frame: one with zero call address.

    The resource hash table provides quick access to the most recent
    record on each profiled resource.  Each hash bin points to a
    resource; the resources in the same bin form a singly linked list,
    a list separate from the singly linked list for resources by
    counter.  A live resource points back to the counter owning that
    resource, permitting that counter to be decremented when the
    resource is released.

    The memory is allocated and the pool otherwise managed by using
    raw operating system pritimives: anonymous memory mappings.  The
    buffer avoids calling any non-trivial library calls.  The buffer
    implementation is safe for use in asynchronous signals provided
    the caller avoids re-enter the same buffer from nested
    signals.  */

  /* Each resource is in two singly linked lists: the hash bin chain
     and the live resources ("leaks") attached to a counter.  Updating
     a resource always updates both linked lists.

     When a resource is acquired, the resource hash table is searched
     for a previously existing record.  If none exists, the resource
     is entered into the first free resource position, either taking
     one from the free list or allocating a new one.  Otherwise the
     existing resource is freed as described below and the search is
     repeated; it is assumed the profiler missed the release of the
     resource.  The counter values are then updated.

     When a resource is released and known in the trace buffer, the
     record is removed from both the counter and resource hash chain
     lists, and put on the free list (the "nextlive" chains the free
     list).  If the resource is not known in the trace buffer it is
     ignored, on the assumption the profiler missed the resource
     acquisition, for example because it wasn't active at the time.  */
